-   Just take max. 4-5 weeks for preparations.

-   Select computerized test
## Preperations

Preparations for IELTS also depend on the goal and qualification of the candidate. My blog especially targets post-graduate prospective students. I would recommend they not enroll in any IELTS coaching center. After 16 years of education, we already have a sufficient level of English in terms of listening, writing, and reading. We just need to focus on test-oriented preparations and speaking practice. In my assessment, a graduate from a reasonable university can get a 6.5 Band without any preparation. But we need to polish our skills to score as maximum as we can.
I am going to share some useful resources that can help you to prepare for IELTS in just **3 to 4 weeks**.
